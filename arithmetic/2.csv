Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Autolysosome; Autophagosome; Flux; LC3; Lysosome; Phagophore; Stress; Vacuole,"animal; autophagy; bioassay; biological model; genetics; human; procedures; Animals; Autophagy; Biological Assay; Humans; Models, Biological","Klionsky, D.J.; Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; email: klionsky@umich.edu",,,15548627,,,22966490,English,Autophagy,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862295360

To determine if lowering of serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations below 6 mg/dl or longer duration of lowered SUA will result in depletion of urate crystals from the knee joints and prevent further attacks of gout. Methods. A prospective study was initiated 10 years ago at Philadelphia VA Medical Center to attempt to maintain SUA levels of patients with crystal proven gout at < 6.0 mg/dl. We recalled all 57 patients who were available during 1999. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A, with SUA still > 6 mg/dl, and Group B, with SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl. A knee joint aspirate was requested from all asymptomatic Group B patients and many in Group A. Aspirates were examined by polarized light microscopy for identification of crystals. Results. There were no differences between the groups in age, sex, duration of gout, or serum creatinine. Group A (n = 38) had a mean of 6 attacks of gout for the recent year, those with tophi having the most frequent attacks. Among the 16 patients in this group who agreed to knee aspiration, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were found in 14, although they were asymptomatic at the time. Nineteen patients (Group B) were able to maintain serum urate levels ≤ 6 mg/dl for > 12 months. Nearly half of them had no attack of gout for 2 or more years, with a mean of 1 attack in the last year for the whole group. Three patients in whom tophi were found did not have major flares of gout within the past year. Knee joint aspiration was done on 16 asymptomatic patients. Seven (44%) still had MSU crystals present in their knees. Patients in this group who were taking prophylactic colchicine did not differ with respect to the character of synovial fluid from those who had discontinued it for up to several years, although the frequency of attacks was less in those who continued colchicine. Conclusion. A majority of patients were able to deplete urate crystal stores in their knee joint fluids when their SUA levels were kept to ≤ 6 mg/dl for several years. The mechanisms for persistence in some patients, and whether such crystals have clinical implications, are not known. Patients with chronic gout need serum urate concentrations to be kept low to prevent further attacks.",Allopurinol; Chronic gout; Colchicine; Urate crystals,allopurinol; colchicine; creatinine; urate; uric acid; arthrocentesis; article; gout; human; major clinical study; male; microscopy; priority journal; Allopurinol; Chronic Disease; Colchicine; Crystallization; Extracellular Space; Follow-Up Studies; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Uric Acid,"Li-Yu, J.; Sect.

The reason for concentric demyelination in this variant of multiple sclerosis is unclear. In the present study we investigated the immunopathology in autopsy tissue of 14 patients with acute multiple sclerosis or fulminant exacerbations of chronic multiple sclerosis with Baló-type lesions in the CNS, focusing on the patterns of tissue injury in actively demyelinating lesions. We found that all active concentric lesions followed a pattern of demyelination that bears resemblances to hypoxia-like tissue injury. This was associated with high expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in macrophages and microglia. At the edge of active lesions and, less consistently, in the outermost layer of preserved myelin, proteins involved in tissue preconditioning, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and heat-shock protein 70, were expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes and to a lesser degree also in astrocytes and macrophages. Due to their neuroprotective effects, the rim of periplaque tissue, where these proteins are expressed, may be resistant to further damage in an expanding lesion and may therefore remain as a layer of preserved myelinated tissue. © The Author (2005).

Neuromelanin accumulates during aging and is the catecholamine-derived pigment of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus, the two neuronal populations most targeted in Parkinson's disease. Many cellular redox reactions rely on iron, however an altered distribution of reactive iron is cytotoxic. In fact, increased levels of iron in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients are present. Dopamine accumulation can induce neuronal death; however, excess dopamine can be removed by converting it into a stable compound like neuromelanin, and this process rescues the cell. Interestingly, the main iron compound in dopamine and norepinephrine neurons is the neuromelanin-iron complex, since neuromelanin is an effective metal chelator. Neuromelanin serves to trap iron and provide neuronal protection from oxidative stress. This equilibrium between iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin is crucial for cell homeostasis and in some cellular circumstances can be disrupted. Indeed, when neuromelanin-containing organelles accumulate high load of toxins and iron during aging a neurodegenerative process can be triggered. In addition, neuromelanin released by degenerating neurons activates microglia and the latter cause neurons death with further release of neuromelanin, then starting a self-propelling mechanism of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Considering the above issues, age-related accumulation of neuromelanin in dopamine neurons shows an interesting link between aging and neurodegeneration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",Dopamine; Human neuromelanin; Iron; Melanin; Parkinson's disease,dopamine; iron; iron derivative; neuromelanin; dopamine; iron; melanin; neuromelanin; biochemistry; cognitive aging; degenerative disease; drug classification; drug structure; drug synthesis; human; iron metabolism; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidation; Parkinson disease; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; substantia nigra; aging; animal; metabolism; Parkinson disease; Aging; Animals; Dopamine; Humans; Iron; Melanins; Parkinson Disease,"Zecca, L.; Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council of Italy, Via Cervi, 93, Italy; email: luigi.zecca@itb.cnr.it",,Elsevier Ltd,3010082,,PGNBA,26455458,English,Prog.

Therefore, noise reduction is still a difficult task. A variety of techniques have been presented in the literature on denoising MR images and each technique has its own assumptions, advantages and limitations. The purpose of this paper is to present a survey of the published literature in dealing with denoising methods in MR images. After a brief introduction about magnetic resonance imaging and the characteristics of noise in MRI, the popular approaches are classified into different groups and an overview of various methods is provided. The denoising method's advantages and limitations are also discussed.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Approximately 40% to 80% of cancer patients undergoing active treatment suffer from CRF. Exercise improves overall quality of life and CRF; however, the specific effects of the training modalities are not well understood. Methods: This study aimed to determine the pooled effects of supervised exercise interventions on CRF in breast cancer survivors. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases between December 2013 and January 2014 without language restrictions. Risk of bias and methodological quality were evaluated using the PEDro score. Pooled effects were calculated with a random-effects model according to the DerSimonian and Laird method. Heterogeneity was evaluated with the I2 test. Results: Nine high-quality studies (n = 1156) were finally included. Supervised aerobic exercise was statistically more effective than conventional care in improving CRF among breast cancer survivors (SMD = -0.51, 95%CI -0.81 to -0.21), with high statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.001; I2 = 75%). Similar effects were found for resistance training on CRF (SMD = -0.41, 95%CI -0.76 to -0.05; P = 0.02; I2 = 64%). Meta-regression analysis revealed that exercise volume parameters are closely related with the effect estimates on CRF. Egger's test suggested moderate evidence of publication bias (P = 0.04). Conclusions: Supervised exercise reduces CRF and must be implemented in breast cancer rehabilitation settings. High-volume exercises are safe and effective in improving CRF and overall quality of life in women with breast cancer.

Methods: Long oval canals from extracted teeth infected with Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) were chemomechanically prepared up to a 40/04 rotary BioRaCe instrument using 2.5% NaOCl irrigation and then subjected to two supplementary protocols. In the passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI)/chlorhexidine (CHX) group, canals were subjected to PUI for the activation of NaOCl followed by a final rinse with 0.2% CHX digluconate solution. In the Hedström group, canals received additional Hedström filing directed towards the buccal and lingual canal recesses. Bacteriological samples were taken before and after preparation, after PUI or Hedström instrumentation, and after CHX final rinsing. Results: Chemomechanical preparation and the supplementary steps promoted a highly significant bacterial reduction (P < .001). Quantitative (reduction in levels) and qualitative (frequency of negative cultures) analyses showed that PUI alone or Hedström filing did not significantly increase bacterial reduction (P > .05). Further rinsing with CHX also failed to significantly increase bacterial elimination when compared with post-PUI samples. However, the cumulative antibacterial effects of PUI and CHX final rinse were effective in significantly reducing bacterial counts to levels below those achieved after preparation (P = .03). This combined PUI/CHX approach also resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of negative cultures (P = .04). Conclusions: Findings suggest that there may be a benefit of using the PUI for the activation of NaOCl followed by a final rinse with CHX as supplementary steps in the treatment of infected oval-shaped root canals.

Currently, there is a general agreement that mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and impaired protein degradation are involved in the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin in Parkinson's disease. Aminochrome has been proposed to play an essential role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, the formation of neurotoxic α-synuclein protofibrils, and impaired protein degradation. Here, we discuss the relationship between the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, the precursor of neuromelanin, autophagy dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin, and the role of dopamine oxidation to aminochrome in autophagy dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. Aminochrome induces the following: (i) the formation of α-synuclein protofibrils that inactivate chaperone-mediated autophagy; (ii) the formation of adducts with α- and β-tubulin, which induce the aggregation of the microtubules required for the fusion of autophagy vacuoles and lysosomes. © 2012 Patricia Muñoz et al.",,alpha synuclein; alpha tubulin; aminochrome; beta tubulin; chaperone; dopamine; glutathione; neuromelanin; pigment; unclassified drug; autophagy; cell vacuole; chemical procedures; conjugation; dopaminergic nerve cell; human; lysosome; microtubule; nonhuman; one electron reduction; oxidation; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein adduct; protein aggregation; protein metabolism; protein modification; review; two electron reduction,"Segura-Aguilar, J.; Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago 8380453, Chile; email: jsegura@med.uchile.cl",,,20420080,,,,English,Parkinson's Dis.,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866261026

The compound exhibits two reversible reduction and oxidation steps with a relatively small electrochemical gap of 1.10 V. The ESR spectra of the ion radicals have a rich hyperfine structure caused by two pairs of equivalent Sc atoms. The Sc-based hyperfine structure with large hyperfine coupling constants shows that both oxidation and reduction of Sc4O2@C80 are in cavea redox processes, which is the subject of endohedral electrochemistry. The assignment of the experimentally determined a(45Sc) values to the two types of Sc atoms in the Sc4O2 cluster was accomplished by extended density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Sc atoms adopting a divalent state in the neutral Sc4O 2@C80 exhibited an especially large coupling constant of 150.4 G in the cation radical, which is the record high a(45Sc) value for Sc-based endohedral metallofullerenes. Such a high value is explained by the nature of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) localized on the six-atom Sc4O2 cluster. This HOMO is a Sc-Sc bonding MO and hence has large contributions from the 4s atomic orbitals of Sc II. We claim that ESR spectroelectrochemistry is an invaluable experimental tool in the studies of metal-metal bonding in endohedral metallofullerenes and in endohedral electrochemistry. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,Anion radicals; Atomic orbital; Cation-radicals; Coupling constants; Divalent state; Endohedral metallofullerenes; Endohedrals; ESR spectra; Fullerene cages; Highest occupied molecular orbital; Hyperfine coupling constants; Hyperfine structure; Ion radicals; Metal-metal bonding; Molecular dynamics simulations; Oxidation and reduction; Redox process; Redox state; Redox-active; Reversible reduction; Scandium oxide; Spectroelectrochemical; Spectroelectrochemical study; Spin density distributions; Voltammetric; Atoms; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Fullerenes; Molecular dynamics; Positive ions; Quantum chemistry; Reduction; Scandium compounds; Spectroelectrochemistry; Scandium; fullerene; radical; scandium; scandium oxide; unclassified drug; article; atom; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical bond; chemical structure; cyclic potentiometry; density functional theory; electrochemistry; electron spin resonance; molecular dynamics; oxidation reduction reaction,"Popov, A.A.; Leibniz-Institute for Solid State and Materials Research, Department of Electrochemistry and Conducting Polymers, 01069 Dresden, Germany; email: a.popov@ifw-dresden.de",,,27863,,JACSA,,English,J.

This study evaluated the demographic, clinical, and microbiologic aspects of periodontitis in a multigeographic sample in Colombia. Methods: Three hundred twenty-five patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), 158 patients with aggressive periodontitis (AgP), and 137 healthy-gingivitis controls from five regions of the country were studied. Clinical, microbial, and sociodemographic data were collected. Microbiologic identification was performed using polymerase chain reaction 16S rRNA gene on pooled subgingival samples, and the presence of Gram-negative enteric rods was evaluated by culture. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Porphyromonas gingivalis occurred in 71.5% of individuals with periodontitis, Tannerella forsythensis occurred in 58.5%, Campylobacter rectus occurred in 57.5%, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans occurred in 23.6%, and enteric rods occurred in 34.5%. P. gingivalis was more common in CP and AgP than controls. A. actinomycetemcomitans was increased in AgP compared to controls and patients with CP. T. forsythensis, C. rectus, and Eikenella corrodens had a low presence in the West Pacific and Central regions, and enteric rods were increased in the Central region (P <0.05). Other sociodemographic factors were not associated with these microorganisms. Conclusions: Geographic regions do not influence the microbiota, but the microbiota may vary by geographic region. P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and C. rectus are the most prevalent periodontophatic microorganisms in Colombia.

There was no relationship between the mBF and the MBL of the mini-implants (Spearman's ρ rs=0.147; P=0.378). At the 15-month follow-up, the average mBF for Group I (ball) was 247.53 ± 132.91 N and that of Group II (bar) only 203.23 ± 76.85 N (Mann-Whitney test; P=0.586). The MBL values were also higher for Group I (1.40 ± 1.02 mm) than Group II (0.84 ± 0.66 mm) during the entire 15-month follow-up period (Mann-Whitney test; P=0.077). Conclusions: No relationship was found between mBF and MBL for patients wearing overdentures retained on mini-implants using bar or ball attachment systems. © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.",Marginal bone loss; Maximum bite force; Mini-implants; Overdentures,"aged; alveolar bone loss; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; denture; edentulousness; female; human; male; mandible; mastication; nonparametric test; prospective study; radiography; randomized controlled trial; tooth prosthesis; treatment outcome; Aged; Alveolar Bone Loss; Bite Force; Dental Prosthesis Design; Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported; Denture, Overlay; Female; Humans; Jaw, Edentulous; Male; Mandible; Prospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome","Jofré, J.; Center for Advanced Prosthodontic and Implantology, CRAI, University of Concepción, Victoria 232, Concepción, Chile; email: jjofre@udec.cl",,,9057161,,,20070758,English,Clin.

University students reacted to one of eight written descriptions of the target individual depicted in a photograph. Results indicated that attitude were least favorable when the subject was male, when the target was homosexual, and when the target had venereal disease or AIDS. In the AIDS condition, subject knowledge about AIDS was positively related to evaluations of a person with AIDS, but not to the desire to interact with him. Social distance responses toward a person with AIDS were not influenced by the target's sexual orientation. AIDS‐phobia and homophobia are suggested as important explanatory variables. It is concluded that simply increasing public knowledge about AIDS is not enough to ensure a more supportive, social environment for persons with AIDS. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

The morphology of the coatings was characterized through optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the crystalline structure was studied through X-ray diffraction (XRD). Chemical composition was evaluated via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hardness of the coatings was measured through nanoindentation, and their wear was studied using the ball on disk test. The electrochemical behavior was assessed with potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance (EIS) tests. The XRD results show the formation of the NbC for the niobium carbide coating, Cr23C6 and Cr7C3 for the chromium carbide coating, and NbC, Cr23C6 and Cr7C3 for the niobium-chromium coating. Hardness value for the niobium-chromium carbide coating was 27.62±2.56GPa, which was higher in comparison to 21.66±0.5GPa for niobium carbide, 14.7±1.1GPa for chromium carbide and 6.70±0.28GPa for the uncoated steel. The wear resistance obtained was higher for the niobium-chromium carbide coating.

The reliability physical fitness tests have not been explored in Latino-American youth population. This study's aim was to examine the reliability of health-related physical fitness tests that were used in the Colombian health promotion ""Fuprecol study"". Participants were 229 Colombian youth (boys n = 124 and girls n = 105) aged 9 to 17.9 years old. Five components of health-related physical fitness were measured: 1) morphological component: height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, and body fat (%) via impedance; 2) musculoskeletal component: handgrip and standing long jump test; 3) motor component: speed/agility test (4×10 m shuttle run); 4) flexibility component (hamstring and lumbar extensibility, sit-and-reach test); 5) cardiorespiratory component: 20-meter shuttle-run test (SRT) to estimate maximal oxygen consumption. The tests were performed two times, 1 week apart on the same day of the week, except for the SRT which was performed only once. Intra-observer technical errors of measurement (TEMs) and inter-rater (reliability) were assessed in the morphological component. Reliability for the Musculoskeletal, motor and cardiorespiratory fitness components was examined using Bland-Altman tests. For the morphological component, TEMs were small and reliability was greater than 95% of all cases. For the musculoskeletal, motor, flexibility and cardiorespiratory components, we found adequate reliability patterns in terms of systematic errors (bias) and random error (95% limits of agreement). When the fitness assessments were performed twice, the systematic error was nearly 0 for all tests, except for the sit and reach (mean difference: -1.03% [95% CI = -4.35% to -2.28%]. The results from this study indicate that the ""Fuprecol study"" health-related physical fitness battery, administered by physical education teachers, was reliable for measuring health-related components of fitness in children and adolescents aged 9-17.9 years old in a school setting in Colombia. © Copyright: 2015 Ramirez-Velez et al.

Methods: Periapical radiographs were used for analyses, and teeth were classified as healthy or diseased according to the periradicular status. Other factors were also evaluated for their association with the periradicular conditions, including gender, quality of both endodontic treatment and coronal restoration, apical level of filling, and presence of post restoration. Results: Fifty-one percent of the treated teeth were classified as healthy. Only 33% of the teeth had endodontic treatment rated as adequate. The quality of both endodontic treatment and coronal restoration significantly influenced the periradicular conditions (P <.001). Combined data revealed that teeth with both adequate endodontic treatment and adequate restorations showed significantly better periradicular status than the other combinations (P < .01), except for teeth with adequate treatment and inadequate restoration (P =.08). Canals filled up to 0-2 mm short of the apex had a significantly higher number of teeth rated as healthy than overfilled or underfilled cases (P =.02). Regression analysis showed that the quality of endodontic treatment was the most significant factor influencing the periradicular status (P <.001). Gender and presence of post restoration had no association with the periradicular conditions. Conclusions: Data from this Colombian population showed a relatively high prevalence of apical periodontitis in root canal-treated teeth. This was largely due to an equally high prevalence of treatments performed under substandard technical quality. The quality of the endodontic treatment was the most determinant factor for healthy periradicular status.

Players were measured in unilateral and bilateral countermovement jump with arms, 5 multiple bounds test, 20-cm drop jump reactive strength index, maximal kicking velocity, sprint and agility test time, endurance, and balance performance. The PT was applied during 6 weeks, 2 sessions per week, for a total of 2,160 jumps. After intervention, all PT groups showed a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) change in all performance measures, with no statistically significant differences between treatments. Among the 21 performance measures, the B + UG showed a significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher performance change in 13 of them vs. the CG, whereas the UG and BG showed only 6 and 3, respectively.

Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants: People diagnosed with any type of cancer, without restriction to a particular stage of diagnosis or treatment. Intervention: Supervised physical activity interventions (eg, aerobic, resistance and stretching exercise), defined as any planned or structured body movement causing an increase in energy expenditure, designed to maintain or enhance health-related outcomes, and performed with systematic frequency, intensity and duration. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was fatigue. Secondary outcomes were physical and functional wellbeing assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue Scale, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Piper Fatigue Scale, Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. Methodological quality, including risk of bias of the studies, was evaluated using the PEDro Scale. Results: Eleven studies involving 1530 participants were included in the review. The assessment of quality showed a mean score of 6.5 (SD 1.1), indicating a low overall risk of bias. The pooled effect on fatigue, calculated as a standardised mean difference (SMD) using a random-effects model, was -1.69 (95% CI -2.99 to -0.39). Beneficial reductions in fatigue were also found with combined aerobic and resistance training with supervision (SMD. = -0.41, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.13) and with combined aerobic, resistance and stretching training with supervision (SMD. = -0.67, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.17). Conclusion: Supervised physical activity interventions reduce cancer-related fatigue. These findings suggest that combined aerobic and resistance exercise regimens with or without stretching should be included as part of rehabilitation programs for people who have been diagnosed with cancer.

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that splint therapy reduced pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area (standardized response mean = -0.93,95 percent confidence interval [CI], -1.33 to -0.53; risk difference for having continued pain = -0.35,95 percent CI, -0.21 to -0.46; mean change on the 100-millimeter visual analog scale = -11.5 mm, 95 percent CI, -16.5 mm to -6.6 mm). Low to very low quality of evidence showed no significant differences between the splint therapy and control groups in terms of quality of life or depression. None of the trial reports described effect on function. Conclusions. Although overall results are promising for the reduction of pain, establishing the role of splints for patients with TMDs will require large trials with stronger safeguards against bias.",Appliance; Craniomandibular disorders; Meta-analysis; Myofascial pain; Splint; Temporomandibular disorders; Temporomandibular joint,,"Ebrahim, S.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, 1280 Main St. West, Hamilton, ON, Canada; email: shanil.ebrahim@utoronto.ca",,American Dental Association,28177,,,22855899,English,J.

A significant increase in cell death was observed when U373MGsiGST6 cells were incubated with 50 μM purified aminochrome (18-fold increase) compared with wild-type cells. The incubation of U373MGsiGST6 cells with 75 μM aminochrome resulted in the formation of autophagic vacuoles containing undigested cellular components, as determined using transmission electron microscopy. A significant increase in autophagosomes was determined by measuring endogenous LC3-II, a significant decrease in cell death was observed in the presence of bafilomycin A1, and a significant increase in cell death was observed in the presence of trehalose. A significant increase in LAMP2 immunostaining was observed, a significant decrease in bright red fluorescence of lysosomes with acridine orange was observed, and bafilomycin A1 pretreatment reduced the loss of lysosome acidity.

Moreover, a significant increase in the number of lipids droplets was observed compared with U373MG cells with normal expression of GSTM2.

Only 22 samples were acquired for this study because renewable energy is an emerging technology. Because historical data regarding renewable energy were limited in sample size and the data were not normally distributed, forecasting methods used for analyzing large amounts of data were unsuitable for this study. Grey system theory is applied to system models involving incomplete information, unclear behavioral patterns, and unclear operating mechanisms. In addition, it can be used to perform comprehensive analyses, observe developments and changes in systems, and conduct long-term forecasts. The most prominent feature of this theory is that a minimum of only four data sets are required for establishing a model and that making stringent assumptions regarding the distribution of the sample population is not required. However, to address the limitations of previous studies on grey forecasting and to enhance the forecasting accuracy, this study adopted the grey model (1, 1) [GM(1, 1)] and the nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (1, 1) [(NGBM)] for theoretical derivation and verification. Subsequently, the two models were compared with a regression analysis model to determine the models' predictive accuracy and goodness of fit. According to the indexes of mean absolute error, mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error, NGBM(1, 1) exhibited the most accurate forecasts, followed by GM(1, 1) and regression analysis model. The results indicated that the modified NGBM(1, 1) grey forecasting models demonstrated superior predictive abilities among the compared models. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Forecasting; Green energy; Grey models; Grey system theory; Renewable energy; Renewable energy law,Energy policy; Energy utilization; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Normal distribution; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Green energy; Grey Model; Grey system theory; Renewable energies; Renewable energy law; System theory,"Tsai, S.-B.; Zhongshan Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, No. 1, Xueyuan Road, China; email: klj0418@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,1618954X,,,,English,Clean Technol.

This filter is based on nonlocal neutrosophic set (NLNS) approach of Wiener filtering. A neutrosophic set (NS), a part of neutrosophy theory, studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. Now, we apply the neutrosophic set into image domain and define some concepts and operators for image denoising. First, the nonlocal mean is applied to the noisy MRI. The resultant image is transformed into NS domain, described using three membership sets: true (T), indeterminacy (I) and false (F). The entropy of the neutrosophic set is defined and employed to measure the indeterminacy. The ω-Wiener filtering operation is used on T and F to decrease the set indeterminacy and to remove the noise. The experiments have been conducted on simulated MR images from Brainweb database and clinical MR images. The results show that the NLNS Wiener filter produces better denoising results in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures compared with other denoising methods, such as classical Wiener filter, the anisotropic diffusion filter, the total variation minimization and the nonlocal means filter. The visual and the diagnostic quality of the denoised image are well preserved. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methodology: Forty PDL samples were obtained from healthy premolars where extraction was indicated for orthodontic reasons. Prior to extraction, 20 of these premolars were divided equally in two groups, and then, root canals were prepared using one of two different single-file systems: WaveOne and Reciproc. Ten premolars were prepared with hand files and served as a positive control group. The remaining 10 premolars where extracted without treatment and served as a negative control group. All PDL samples were processed, and SP and CGRP were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: Greater SP and CGRP expression were found in the hand instrumentation group (1.220 pmol SP and 0.084 pmol CGRP per mg of PDL), followed by the WaveOne group (0.908 pmol SP and 0.046 pmol CGRP per mg of PDL) and the Reciproc group (0.511 pmol SP and 0.022 pmol CGRP per mg of PDL). The lower SP and CGRP values were associated with the intact control group (0.453 pmol SP and 0.018 pmol CGRP per mg of PDL). The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences between groups (P < 0.001). Post hoc Tukey HSD tests revealed significant differences in SP and CGRP expression between intact teeth in the control group and all the other groups (P < 0.001) except with the Reciproc group (P = 0.165 and P = 0.42 for SP and CGRP, respectively). Hand instrumentation was associated with significant differences with all the other groups (P < 0.001). Differences between the WaveOne and Reciproc groups were also significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Substance P and CGRP expression in PDL cells increased when teeth were prepared with WaveOne as well as with hand instrumentation.

The electronic structure was calculated using a combination of density functional theory and multi-reference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI). Equilibrium geometries were optimized employing (time-dependent) density functional theory (B3LYP functional) combined with the TZVP basis set. Solvent effects were estimated using the COSMO model and micro-hydration with up to five explicit water molecules. Our calculated electronic energies are in good agreement with experimental data. We find the lowest excited singlet and triplet states at the ground state geometry to be of π→π* (S 1, S 2, T 1, T 2) and n→π* (S 3, T 3) character. This order changes when the molecular structure in the electronically excited states is relaxed. Geometry relaxation has almost no effect on the energy of the S 1 and T 1 states (∼0.02 eV). The relaxation effects on the energies of S 2 and T 2 are moderate (0.14-0.20 eV). The very small emission energy results in a very low fluorescence rate. While we were not able to locate the energetic minimum of the S 3 state, we found a non-planar minimum for the T 3 state with an energy which is very close to the energy of the S 1 minimum in the gas phase (0.04 eV above). When hydration effects are taken into account, the n→π* states S 3 and T 3 are strongly blueshifted (0.33 and 0.46 eV), while the π→π* states are only slightly affected (&lt;0.06 eV). © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.",,"phenothiazine derivative; solvent; thionine; article; chemical structure; chemistry; conformation; electron; quantum theory; Electrons; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Phenothiazines; Quantum Theory; Solvents","Daza, M.C.; Grupo de Bioquímica Teórica, Universidad Industrial de Santander Carrera, 27 Calle 9, Bucaramanga, Colombia; email: mcdaza@uis.edu.co",,,1474905X,,PPSHC,22134484,English,Photochem.

Methods: cross-sectional study. A sample of 3 005 children and 2 916 adolescents healthy Colombian youth (boys n = 2 542 and girls n = 3 384) participated in the study. Height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference and sexual maturation status were measured. Reference curves were fitted with the LMS method (L [curve Box– Cox], M [curve median] and S [curve coefficient of variation]), for boys and girls, stratified by age group, and to compare them to international references. Results: in all ages, the waist/hip ratio was higher in boys than in girls. Subjects whose waist/hip ratio was above the 90th percentile of the standard normal distribution were considered to have high cardiovascular risk (boys range 0.87 to 0.93 and girls range 0.85 to 0.89). Overall, our waist/hip ratio values were lower than Europe, Asia and Africa values and similar to those of some Latin American references. Conclusions: values reference charts for waist/hip ratio values specific for age and sex, obtained from children and adolescents from Bogota, Colombia, are provided. They may be used regionally, both for nutritional assessment and to predict cardiovascular risks in early age. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

First package contains improved and threaded version of sequential C programs using OpenMP. Second package additionally parallelizes three-dimensional variants of the OpenMP programs using MPI, allowing them to be run on distributed-memory systems. Finally, previous three-dimensional CUDA-parallelized programs are further parallelized using MPI, similarly as the OpenMP programs. We also present speedup test results obtained using new versions of programs in comparison with the previous sequential C and parallel CUDA programs. The improvements to the sequential version yield a speedup of 1.1–1.9, depending on the program.

Methods: a sample of 149 healthy Colombian youth, children and adolescents (9–17.9 years old) participated in the study. Physical activity level was assessed over 7 days using an accelerometer. Weight, height, waist circumference, hip waist, subscapular/ triceps skinfold thicknesses and self-reported screen time (television/internet and videogame-viewing time) were measured. Aerobic capacity, handgrip strength, standing broad jump, vertical jump, speed/agility and flexibility were used as indicators of physical fitness. Results: in girls with a high level of physical activity had favorable aerobic capacity (r = 0.366) and inverse relationship with subscapular/triceps skinfold thicknesses (r = -0.257) and (r = -0,237) p < 0.05, respectively. In boys, vigorous physical activity were associated with higher values of flexibility (r = 0.277) and aerobic capacity (r = 0.347), p < 0.05. Finally, the participants who watched 2 h or less of television per day showed 1.81 times (95%CI 1.401 to 2.672) that met physical activity guidelines. Conclusions: the healthy Colombian youth who reported moderate to vigorous objective measures of physical activity levels, presented higher levels in physical fitness especially in aerobic capacity and flexibility and lower values in subscapular/triceps skinfold thicknesses. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

The purpose of the study was to examine the associations of carbapenem resistance with mortality, length of hospital stay and hospital costs among patients infected with A. baumannii in intensive-care units (ICUs) in Colombia. A prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted among 165 patients with A. baumannii infection admitted to ICUs between April 2006 and April 2010. Patients with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii had higher risk of 30-day mortality than patients with carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii in the univariate analysis (unadjusted hazard ratio = 2.12; 95% CI 1.14-3.95; p 0.018). However, carbapenem resistance was not significantly associated with risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.45; 95% CI 0.74-2.87; p 0.28) after adjusting for APACHE II score and other confounding factors. We did not find a significant difference in length of stay in ICU after the onset of infection between the two groups in the multivariate analysis (adjusted mean = 13.1 days versus 10.5 days; p 0.14). The average total cost of hospitalization among patients with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was significantly higher than that among patients with carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii in the multivariate analysis (adjusted cost; US$ 11 359 versus US$ 7049; p <0.001). Carbapenem resistance was not significantly associated with mortality, though we are unable to rule out an increased risk due to the limited sample size.

First, we complement the group consensus literature on crucial stability analysis, using a recent technique called the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR) for the first time on this class of time-delayed systems. The CTCR paradigm is pursued after a block-diagonalization (mode-decoupling) transformation on the system. This treatment produces some unique stability tables for the dynamics in the space of the delays which are non-conservative and exhaustive. Second, a novel concept of spectral delay space is presented, as an overture to the CTCR for the determination of the complete set of stability-crossing (switching) hypersurfaces in the delay space. Examples are provided to display the strengths and efficiency of this new stability analysis mechanism. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Social interactions of 30 high-yielding dairy goats were recorded over a period of 16 days for 96 h. The variables measured were social interactions, conflict resolution, individual behaviours and morphological characteristics. Using seven variables of social interactions, through the test of factor analysis three factors were obtained that concentrated the 92.3% of the variance. These were labelled as 'avoider' factor (36.9%), 'no-agonistic' factor (28.1%) and 'agonistic' factor (27.3%). Subsequently a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed in order to identify identity profiles (groups of similar animals) which could help to explain the possible association between social strategies (obtained from the factor analysis) and index of success, conflict resolution, social and individual behaviour and morphometric characteristics. Social strategies, dominance, conflict resolution, and the time they devote to feeding and resting, beard length, thoracic circumference and the particular association of each one of these characteristics has allowed us to identify four types of identity profiles which we have termed aggressive, affiliative, passive, and avoiders. Our results show the existence of an association between social strategies with identity profiles in dairy goats.

In this task, the existence of damage should be determined. In the literature, several potentially useful techniques for damage detection can be found, and their applicability to a particular situation depends on the size of the critical damages that are admissible in the structure. Almost all of these techniques follow the same general procedure: the structure is excited using actuators, and the dynamical response is sensed at different locations throughout the structure. Any damage will change this vibrational response. The state of the structure is diagnosed by means of the processing of these data. Several studies have shown that the detection of changes in a structure depends on the distance from the damage to the actuator as well as the configuration of the sensor network. In this article, the authors considered the advantage of using an active piezoelectric system, where the lead zirconate titanate transducers are used as actuator and sensors in different actuation phases. In each actuation phase of the diagnosis procedure, one lead zirconate titanate transducer is used as actuator (a known electrical signal is applied), and the others are used as sensors (collecting the wave propagated through the structure at different points). An initial baseline model for undamaged structure is built applying principal component analysis to the data collected by several experiments and after the current structure (damaged or not) is subjected to the same experiments, and the collected data are projected into the principal component analysis models. Two of these projections and four damage indices (T 2-statistic, Q-statistic, combined index, and I 2 index) by each actuation phase are used to determine the presence of damages and to distinguish between them. These indices are calculated based on the analysis of the residual data matrix to represent the variability of the data projected within the residual subspace and the new space of the principal components. To validate the approach, data from two aeronautical structures - an aircraft skin panel and an aircraft turbine blade - are used. © SAGE Publications.",active piezoelectric system; damage detection; damage indices; principal component analysis,Actuators; Damage detection; Data handling; Ferroelectric ceramics; Fighter aircraft; Piezoelectricity; Semiconducting lead compounds; Sensor networks; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Titanium compounds; Transducers; Turbomachine blades; Aeronautical structures; Damage index; Detection of changes; Lead zirconate titanate; Piezoelectric system; Principal Components; Structural damage detection; Vibrational response; Principal component analysis,"Tibaduiza, D.A.; MEM (Research Group on Monitoring-Electronics and Modelling), Faculty of Electronics Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás-Colombia, Cra 9 No. 51-11, Colombia; email: diegotibaduiza@usantotomas.edu.co",,SAGE Publications Ltd,1045389X,,JMSSE,,English,J Intell Mater Syst Struct,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951819193

Calculated ADMETox parameters of the designed analogs revealed their good pharmacokinetic profiles indicating lipophilic characteristics. In vitro AChE enzyme test showed that obtained α-aminonitriles could be considered as AChEIs with micromolar IC 50 values ranging from 42.0 to 478.0 μM (10.3-124.0 μg/mL). Among this series, the best AChE inhibitor was the pyrrolidine α-aminonitrile 3 (IC50 = 42 μM), followed by the piperidine α-aminonitriles 2 and 6 (IC50 = 45 μM and IC50 = 51 μM, respectively), and the compound 7 (IC50 = 51 μM). In vivo insecticidal activity of more active AChEIs against Aedes aegypti larvae was also performed showing a good larvicidal activity at concentrations less than 140 ppm, highlighting products 2 and 7 that could serve as lead compounds to develop new potent and selective insecticides. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methodology: The study included 120 patients from Bucaramanga City, Colombia, 63 diagnosed with acute suppurative AP (ASAP) and 57 diagnosed with chronic nonsuppurative AP (CNAP). Genotyping for IL1B +3954 (rs1143634), IL8 / CXCL8 -251 (rs4073), IL12B +1188 (rs3212227) and TNFA -308 (rs1800629) was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms method. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA 10.0 and PLINK V1.07 software. Results: Significant differences in the distribution of IL8 / CXCL8 -251 A allele (P adjusted = 0.041; OR adjusted = 0.41, CI adjusted = 0.31-0.97) and IL8 / CXCL -251 TT genotype (P adjusted = 0.04; OR adjusted = 2.24, CI adjusted = 1.04-4.84) were observed comparing patients diagnosed with ASAP and CNAP. No association was observed in genotype and allele distribution for other genetic polymorphisms analysed. Conclusion: This study provides molecular epidemiological evidence that suggests in the present cohort that IL8 / CXCL8 -251 T allele, which is associated with higher production of IL8/CXCL8, is also associated with a higher risk of developing acute suppurative form of AP, whereas IL8 / CXCL8 -251 A allele, which is associated with lower production of IL8/CXCL8, is associated with chronic nonsuppurative form of AP. This suggests a pivotal role for IL-8/CXCL8 in periapical disease because of its ability to induce chemotaxis and modulating the directed migration of neutrophils to the site of inflammation in response to microbial infection of pulp. © 2012 International Endodontic Journal.",Apical periodontitis; Colombia; Cytokines; Inflammation; Single nucleotide polymorphisms,"adenine; autacoid; cytokine; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 8; thymine; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adolescent; adult; allele; article; cohort analysis; Colombia; comparative study; female; genetics; genotype; human; immunology; male; middle aged; neutrophil chemotaxis; restriction fragment length polymorphism; single nucleotide polymorphism; tooth periapical disease; young adult; Adenine; Adolescent; Adult; Alleles; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Cohort Studies; Colombia; Cytokines; Female; Genotype; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Interleukin-12 Subunit p40; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-8; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophil Infiltration; Periapical Abscess; Periapical Granuloma; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Thymine; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Young Adult","Flórez, O.; Escuela de Bacteriología, Facultad de Salud, Carrera 32 #29-31, Oficina 419, Bucaramanga, Colombia; email: o.florezvargas@gmail.com",,,1432885,,IENJE,22788685,English,Int.

Therefore, the implementation of technology to provide robust solutions in damage identification (by using signals acquired directly from the structure) is a requirement to reduce operational and maintenance costs. In this sense, the use of sensors permanently attached to the structures has demonstrated a great versatility and benefit since the inspection system can be automated. This automation is carried out with signal processing tasks with the aim of a pattern recognition analysis. This work presents the detailed description of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system based on the use of a piezoelectric (PZT) active system. The SHM system includes: (i) the use of a piezoelectric sensor network to excite the structure and collect the measured dynamic response, in several actuation phases; (ii) data organization; (iii) advanced signal processing techniques to define the feature vectors; and finally; (iv) the nearest neighbor algorithm as a machine learning approach to classify different kinds of damage.

An initial baseline pattern for each actuation phase for the healthy structure is built by applying multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) to wavelet approximation coefficients calculated using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) from ultrasonic signals which are collected during several experiments. In addition, experiments are performed with the structure in different states (simulated damages), pre-processed and projected into the different baseline patterns for each actuator. Some of these projections and squared prediction errors (SPE) are used as input feature vectors to a self-organizing map (SOM), which is trained and validated in order to build a final pattern with the aim of providing an insight into the classified states. The methodology is tested using ultrasonic signals collected from an aluminium plate and a stiffened composite panel. Results show that all the simulated states are successfully classified no matter what the kind of damage or the temperature is in both structures. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",damage classification; damage index; discrete wavelet transform (DWT); principal component analysis (PCA); selforganizing maps (SOM); structural health monitoring (SHM); temperature effects,Conformal mapping; Damage detection; Discrete wavelet transforms; Experiments; Principal component analysis; Sensor networks; Signal detection; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Temperature; Thermal effects; Damage classification; Damage index; Multiway principal component analysis; Piezoelectric active sensors; selforganizing maps (SOM); Squared prediction errors; Stiffened composite panel; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Ultrasonic applications,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,9641726,,SMSTE,,English,Smart Mater Struct,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896384564

Taking into account physical activity patterns in college students, it is necessary to establish its association with the excessive weight in order to prevent and to decrease the prevalence of future chronic diseases. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between excessive weight and physical inactivity among college students. Material and methods: An analytical cross sectional study was carried out in 2013 among college students from a private university of Bucaramanga, Colombia. Students (n=306) 18 to 25 years old were included using simple random sampling. An interview was realized using a survey that included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), together with socio demographic variables. An assessment of body composition was realized in order to measure height, weight, body mass index (BMI), total fat percentage, and waist and hip circumferences. A trained professional in physical activity was in charge of data collection and anthropometric measurements. This study was approved by the university research and ethics committee. Participation was both voluntary and anonymous. All data were analyzed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written consent was signed by every participant of the study. A descriptive analysis of the studied population’s general characteristics was realized. The association between excessive weight and physical inactivity was estimated using regression logistic models that allows estimate row and adjusted Odds Ratios (OR). Results: An excessive weight was observed in 26.47% of the students, among which 20.26% were overweight and 6.21% obese, according to BMI cutoff. Taking into account the total fat percentage, 12.09% of the students were in risk of becoming obese and 10.13% were already obese. 50.56% of the students practiced very little weekly physical activity. The median of daily sedentary lifestyle was 12 hours, with an interquartile range of 4 hours. A statistically significant association was found between excessive weight and sedentary behavior, according to the total fat method (adjusted OR: 1.11, CI 95%: 1.01-1.23). Conclusions: College students’ health behavior is often inadequate in terms of physical activity and dietary habits. Our study observed an association between physical inactivity and excessive weight. Physical inactivity is an important lifestyle factor related to chronic diseases. Further research should focus on determinants to increase their physical activity and to improve their daily lifestyle in order to lower the risk of future diseases. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

They had no indication of cardiometabolic problems, as evaluated by clinical interview. MF was measured by isometric handgrip (dynamometer). The handgrip strength was divided by body mass was used in further analysis. Lower and higher MF values are represented by the first and fourth quartiles, respectively. A lipid-metabolic cardiovascular risk index was derived from the levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and glucose. Adiposity index were assessed by measuring, waist circumference (WC), body adiposity index (BAI), body mass index (BMI) and fat mass (%).Results: After adjustment for age, BMI and WC, inverse association was observed between fat mass, WC, cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and MF (p<0.05) . In addition, subjects with low handgrip strength/kg body mass (Q1), shower high levels of fat mass, WC, cholesterol, HDL-c and LDL-c (p<0.05 linear). Lasted, a linear relationship was also observed between the MF/kg and the lipid-metabolic index (p<0.05).Conclusions: In Colombian young adult poorer handgrip strength/kg body mass were associated with worse metabolic risk factors and adiposity index.

The radiationless deactivation channels {S<inf>1</inf>,S<inf>2</inf>(π → π*) → T<inf>1</inf>,T<inf>2</inf>(π → π*)} have been examined. Since the direct ISC does not explain the high triplet quantum yield in this system, attention has been centered on the vibronic spin-orbit coupling between the low-lying singlet and triplet (π → π*) states of interest. An efficient population transfer from the S<inf>1</inf>(π<inf>H</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) state to the T<inf>2</inf>(π<inf>H-1</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) state via this channel is confirmed. The calculated ISC rate constant for this channel is k<inf>ISC</inf> ≈ 3.35 × 10 8 s-1, which can compete with the radiative depopulation of the S<inf>1</inf>(π<inf>H</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) state via fluorescence (k<inf>F</inf> ≈ 1.66 × 108 s-1) in a vacuum. The S<inf>1</inf>(π<inf>H</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) → T<inf>1</inf>(π<inf>H</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) and {S<inf>2</inf>(π<inf>H-1</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) → T <inf>1</inf>,T<inf>2</inf>(π → π*)} ISC channels have been estimated to be less efficient (k<inf>ISC</inf> ≈ 105-10 6 s-1). Based on the computed ISC rate constants and excited-state solvent shifts, it is suggested that the efficient triplet quantum yield of thionine in water is primarily due to the S<inf>1</inf>(π <inf>H</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) → T<inf>2</inf>(π <inf>H-1</inf> → π<inf>L</inf>*) channel with a computed rate constant of the order of 108-109 s-1 which is in accord with the experimental finding (k<inf>ISC</inf> = 2.8 × 10 9 s-1). © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies 2012.",,"phenothiazine derivative; thionine; water; article; chemistry; quantum theory; theoretical model; thermodynamics; vacuum; Models, Theoretical; Phenothiazines; Quantum Theory; Thermodynamics; Vacuum; Water","Marian, C.M.; Institute of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University of Düsseldorf, Universitätsstr. 1, D-40225 Düsseldorf, Germany; email: Christel.Marian@uni-duesseldorf.de",,Royal Society of Chemistry,1474905X,,PPSHC,22903089,English,Photochem.

Methods: Thirty human dental pulp samples were obtained from healthy premolars in which extraction was indicated for orthodontic reasons. Before extraction, teeth were divided into 3 groups of 10 premolars each: (1) the control group: healthy premolars without application of orthodontic forces; (2) the moderate force group: a 56-g force was applied to the premolars for 24 hours; and (3) the severe force group: a 224-g force was applied to the premolars for 24 hours. All dental pulp samples were processed, and CGRP was measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: Greater CGRP expression was found in the severe force group followed by the moderate force group. The lower CGRP values were for the control group. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistically significant differences between groups (P < .0001). Least significant difference (LSD) post hoc tests showed statistically significant differences in CGRP expression between the control group and the severe force group (P < .0001) but not with the moderate force group (P = .06). Differences between the moderate and severe force groups were statistically significant (P < .0001). Conclusions: CGRP expression in human dental pulp increases when teeth are submitted to severe orthodontic forces.

A secondary aim was to analyze measurement invariance of the AAQ-II across nonclinical and clinical samples considering that previous research has yielded mixed results. The AAQ-II was administered to a total of 1759 participants, including a sample of undergraduates, one of general population, and a clinical sample. Data were very similar to the ones obtained in the original AAQ-II version. The internal consistency across the different samples was good (Cronbach’s alpha between 0.88 and 0.91). The one-factor model found in the original scale showed a good fit to the data. Measurement invariance was also found across sample (clinical and nonclinical) and gender. The mean score of the clinical sample on the AAQ-II was significantly higher than the scores of the nonclinical samples. The AAQ-II was sensitive to the effects of a one-session ACT intervention, and AAQ-II scores were significantly related to emotional symptoms, mindfulness, satisfaction with life, and dysfunctional attitudes.

Up to now, few studies have evaluated the performance of BAI in determining excess fat in Colombians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of BAI as a predictor of body fat in among Colombian adults. Methods: cross-sectional study carried out in a sample of 204 male belonging to the education sector from Bogotá, Colombia. BAI was calculated based on the equation reported in the Bergman et al. %BF determined by tetrapolar bioimpedance analysis (BIA) was used as the reference measure of adiposity. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the agreement between the two methods: BAI and BIA. Associations between anthropometric measures of adiposity were investigated by Pearson correlation analysis. Results: in general pupulation, the BAI overestimates %BF (mean difference: 12.5 % [95%CI = -4.04 % to -21.02 %]), mainly at lower levels of adiposity (mean difference: 10.2 ± 3.3). Significant correlations were found between BAI and all measurements, being the strongest-moderate correlation with %BF (r = 0.777, p< 0.001), waist to height ratio (r = 0.557, p< 0.001) and BMI (r = 0.480, p< 0.001). Conclusion: the results of this investigation indicate that BAI results in large individual errors when predicting BF% among Colombian adults and has a tendency to provide overestimated values as BF% decreases. Therefore, this method can be a useful tool to predict %BF in Colombian adults, although it has some limitations. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

This paper introduces a bioinspired strategy for the detection of structural changes using an artificial immune system (AIS) and a statistical data-driven modeling approach by means of a distributed piezoelectric active sensor network at different actuation phases. Damage detection and classification of structural changes using ultrasonic signals are traditionally performed using methods based on the time of flight. The approach followed in this paper is a data-based approach based on AIS, where sensor data fusion, feature extraction, and pattern recognition are evaluated. One of the key advantages of the proposed methodology is that the need to develop and validate a mathematical model is eliminated. The proposed methodology is applied, tested, and validated with data collected from two sections of an aircraft skin panel. The results show that the presented methodology is able to accurately detect damage. © 2015 Maribel Anaya et al.",,Algorithms; Damage detection; Data fusion; Feature extraction; Immune system; Pattern recognition; Sensor data fusion; Sensor networks; Ultrasonic applications; Artificial Immune System; Critical structures; Industrial sector; Operational reliability; Piezoelectric active sensors; Statistical datas; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Ultrasonic signals; Structural health monitoring,"Pozo, F.; CoDAlab, Department of Applied Mathematics III, Escola Universitària d'Enginyeria Tècnica Industrial de Barcelona (EUETIB), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Comte d'Urgell 187, Spain; email: francesc.pozo@upc.edu",,Hindawi Limited,10709622,,SHVIE,,English,Shock Vib,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945296416

In this paper, neutrosophic set is applied in image domain and a new directional α-mean operation is defined. Based on this operation, neutrosophic set is applied into image edge detection procedure. First, the image is transformed into NS domain, which is described by three membership sets: T, I and F. Then, a directional α-mean operation is employed to reduce the indeterminacy of the image. Finally, a neutrosophic edge detection algorithm (NSED) is proposed based on the neutrosophic set and its operation to detect edge. Experiments have been conducted using numerous artificial and real images. The results demonstrate the NSED can detect the edges effectively and accurately. Particularly, it can remove the noise effect and detect the edges on both the noise-free images and the images with different levels of noises. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The study included 20 nulliparous in gestational week 16-20, attending prenatal care at three tertiary hospitals in Colombia who were randomly assigned into one of two groups: The exercise group (n = 10) took part in an exercise session three times a week for 12 weeks which consisted of: aerobic exercise at an intensity of 55-75% of their maximum heart rate for 60 min and 25 mins. Resistance exercise included 5 exercise groups circuit training (50 repetitions of each) using barbells (1-3 kg/exercise) and low-to-medium resistance bands. The control group (n = 10) undertook their usual physical activity. Mitochondrial and cytosol fractions were isolated from human placental tissue by differential centrifugation. A spectrophotometric assay was used to measure NO production in cytosolic samples from placental tissue and Western Blot technique to determine eNOS expression. Mitochondrial superoxide levels and hydrogen peroxide were measured to determine oxygen metabolism. Results: Combined aerobic and resistance exercise training during pregnancy leads to a 2-fold increase in eNOS expression and 4-fold increase in NO production in placental cytosol (p = 0.05). Mitochondrial superoxide levels and hydrogen peroxide production rate were decreased by 8% and 37% respectively in the placental mitochondria of exercising women (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Regular exercise training during the second half of pregnancy increases eNOS expression and NO production and decreases reactive oxygen species generation in human placenta. Collectively, these data demonstrate that chronic exercise increases eNOS/NO production, presumably by increasing endothelial shear stress. This adaptation may contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on the vascular and antioxidant system and in turn reduce the risk of preeclampsia, diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy. © 2013 Ramírez-Vélez et al.",,"Adolescent; Exercise; Female; Gene Expression; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Mitochondria; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Oxygen; Placenta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Superoxides; Young Adult","Facultad de Cultura Física, Deporte Y Recreación, Universidad Santo Tomás, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia",,,19326203,,POLNC,24244656,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893627466

The investigation involved 79 patients in treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, ages 41 yo 60 years. The Activities of Daily Living was applied. Also the index of RAI and the Scale of Self-efficacy for Arthritis. It was found that perceived self efficacy has a negative correlation wit helplessness, pain and functional incapacity. At the sometime, these three variables relate in a positive form. From the preceding it can be concluded that adequate self efficacy permits a more favorable attitude toward the illness and an adaptation to the lifestyle changes brought on by it. Helplessness, for its part, relates to pain, and pain relates with incapacity, from which one can infer an indirect relation to helplessness. The results of this investigation confirm the significant weight of psychological variables have concerning adaptation to rheumatoid arthritis.

The aim of the current study was to determine concentrations of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and a metalloid arsenic (As) found in the species of most consumed fish species by citizens of Bogota D.C. (Colombia), and the consequent potential risk to human health was also calculated. Muscle samples of 8 fish species were obtained from 203 individuals collected through 2014. The highest metal concentrations detected were as follows: Pb in Oncorhynchus sp. (0.0595 mg/kg), Cd and Hg in Pimelodus sp. (0.0072 and 0.0579 mg/kg, respectively), and As in Scomberomorus sp (0.0471 mg/kg). Further, the levels of metal accumulation from consumption of fish were calculated utilizing the metal pollution index (MPI), with elevated values noted in Pseudoplatystoma sp (0.06 mg/kg), followed by Scomberomorus sp. and Centropomus sp. (0.05 and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively). The multiple species exposure index (Em.j) denotes the level of exposure associated with consumption of various contaminated fish species, and this level occurred in decreasing order as follows: As &gt; Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Hg. The multiple chemical exposure index (Ej.m), which accounts for exposure to multiple metals, identified Prochilodus sp. as the species displaying the highest level of exposure per consumption (8 × 10 -6 mg/kg-d). The target hazard quotient (THQ) for human health indicated high levels for Hg and Cd in Prochilodus sp. (0.026 and 0.005, respectively), Pb in Oncorhynchus sp (0.025), and As in Pseudoplatistoma sp. and Centropomus sp. (0.023).

DeGroote Institute for Pain Research and Care, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) has recommended that trialists evaluating treatments for chronic pain should consider reporting 9 patient-important outcome domains. We examined the extent to which clinical trials evaluating the effect of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) report outcome domains recommended by IMMPACT. We systematically searched electronic databases for English-language studies that randomized patients with CNCP to receive an opioid or a non-opioid control. In duplicate and independently, reviewers established the eligibility of each identified study and recorded all reported outcome domains from eligible trials. We conducted a priori regression analyses to explore factors that may be associated with IMMPACT-recommended outcome domains. Among 156 eligible trials, reporting of IMMPACT-recommended outcome domains was highly variable, ranging from 99% for pain to 7% for interpersonal functioning. Recently published trials were more likely to report the effect of treatment on physical functioning, emotional functioning, role functioning, sleep and fatigue, and participant disposition. Trials for which the corresponding author was from North America were more likely to report treatment effects on physical functioning and participant ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment. Trials published in higher impact journals were more likely to report treatment effects on emotional function, but less likely to report participant ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment. Most IMMPACT domains showed an increased rate of reporting over time, although many patient-important outcome domains remained unreported by over half of all trials evaluating the effects of opioids for CNCP. © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.",Chronic pain; Clinical trials; Core outcome domains; IMMPACT,"opiate; narcotic analgesic agent; Article; cancer control; cancer pain; chronic non cancer pain; chronic non cancer pain; chronic pain; emotion; fatigue; human; North America; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; priority journal; systematic review; bibliographic database; chronic pain; clinical trial (topic); statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Analgesics, Opioid; Chronic Pain; Clinical Trials as Topic; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Treatment Outcome","Busse, J.W.; Department of Anesthesia, McMaster University, Michael G.

A neutrosophic set, a part of neutrosophy theory, studies the origin, nature and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. Now, we apply the neutrosophic set into image domain and define some concepts and operators for image denoising. The image is transformed into NS domain, described using three membership sets: True (T), Indeterminacy (I) and False (F). The entropy of the neutrosophic set is defined and employed to measure the indeterminacy. The ω-wiener filtering operation is used on T and F to decrease the set indeterminacy and remove noise. The experiments have conducted on simulated Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) from Brainweb database and clinical MR images corrupted by Rician noise. The results show that the NS wiener filter produces better denoising results in terms of visual perception, qualitative and quantitative measures compared with other denoising methods, such as classical wiener filter, the anisotropic diffusion filter, the total variation minimization scheme and non local means filter.",Denoising; Magnetic Resonance imaging; Neutrosophic Set; Rician distribution; Wiener,Anisotropic diffusion filters; De-noising; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Neutrosophic sets; Non- local means filters; Rician distribution; Total variation minimization; Wiener; Adaptive filtering; Magnetic resonance imaging; Image denoising,"Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, P A College of Engineering and Technology, Pollachi, Tamilnadu 642002, India",,,13358871,,,,English,Meas.

Sweeteners are used to replace sugar either in part or entirely. Objective: To determine the consumption of artificial sweeteners in school children 6 to 14 years of age in the Valparaiso Region of Chile and to compare consumption according to nutritional status. Methods: 281 students of both sexes underwent anthropometric assessment (weight and height) and completed a food survey on the consumption of sweeteners. Results: 100% of students consume foods or products containing artificial sweeteners, although no student consumed more than the maximum allowed. When comparing by nutritional status, obese children, compared to those with normal weight had a higher consumption of sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame potassium (p <0.05). Conclusion: The intake of sweeteners is massive, but consumption does not exceed permitted levels in this study sample.",Artificial sweeteners; Aspartame; Nutritional status; Saccharin; Students,,"Samuel Durán, A.; Universidad Santo Tomás, 1 Norte 3041, piso 8, Viña del Mar, Chile; email: sduran74@gmail.com",,,7177518,,,,English; Spanish,Rev.

A. 678, Bucaramanga, Colombia","The essential oil (EO) of clove bud dried fruits from Eugenia caryophyllus was obtained by a conventional hydrodistillation process in an excellent yield (11.7 %). Its chemical composition was analyzed by GC-MS, identifying eugenol as a main constituent (60.5%). Four eugenol-like molecules, γ-diisoeugenol, hydroxymethyleugenol, dihydroeugenol and 1,3-dioxanylphenol, were synthe-sized using eugenol or isoeugenol as initial precursors under green chemistry protocols. To evaluate the possible antioxidant capacity of eugenol compounds including the clove bud EO, the Trolox® Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity value, obtained by the ABTS +• radical-cation discoloration method, was employed. The methodology was performed in a UV-Vis reader of 96-well microplates (dilution methodology), using well-known antioxidant agents (BHA, BHT and vitamin E) as reference compounds. It was found that the prepared eugenol derivatives had a more potent free radical scavenger activity than the reference compounds. In particular, the most active molecules, γ-diisoeugenol and 1,3-dioxanylphenol, were ca. 3-fold more potent than vitamin E. © Merchán Arenas et al.",Abts radical-cation; Antioxidant activity; Clove essential oil; Eugenol; Free radical scavenger activity; Gc-ms; Isoeugenol,"1 ethyl 5 hydroxy cis 3 (4 hydroxy 5 methoxyphenyl) 6 methoxy trans 2 methylindane 1 ethyl 3 (4 hydroxy 3 methoxyphenyl) 6 methoxy 2 methyl 2,3 dihydro 1h inden 5 ol; 2 methoxy 4 [5 methyl 1,3 dioxan 4 yl]phenol; 2 methoxy 4 propylphenol; 2,2' azinobis(3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid); 4 (1,3 dioxanyl)phenol; 4 allyl 2 (hydroxymethyl) 6 methoxyphenol; alpha tocopherol; butylated hydroxyanisole; butylcresol; clove oil; dihydroeugenol; essential oil; eugenol; gamma diisoeugenol; hydroxymethyleugenol; isoeugenol; phenol derivative; scavenger; unclassified drug; antioxidant activity; article; chemical composition; clove; controlled study; decolorization; dilution; drug potency; drug synthesis; eugenia caryophyllus; green chemistry; hydrodistillation; mass fragmentography; medicinal plant; ultraviolet radiation","Kouznetsov, V.
